# Power-BI-Project
Fruit Sales and Inventory

This Power BI project enabled me to provide a comprehensive analysis of sales and inventory for the fruit
and vegetable-based company. By utilizing data visualization and analytics, delivered valuable insights on
customer patterns, such as the number of customers purchasing specific fruits and vegetables, helping the
company understand customer preferences and demand. I have attached the dataset and the final dashboard for the analysis understanding. 
However I have not created a separate analysis Report.
